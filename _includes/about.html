          Meet Katie. Katie is starting a new job for the third time in the last
          five years. Her employer has set her up with a 401(k) plan, but Katie
          doesn’t want to start saving from scratch. She’s determined to find
          her old passwords and take action.

          Katie has three options. A lot of her friends have cashed out their
          accounts, but lost half of their nest egg penalties and taxes. Katie
          could also do nothing, but she's worried about juggling multiple
          investments and rising fees eroding her old balances.
