          Meet Katie. Katie is starting a new job for the third time in the last
          five years. Her employer has set her up with a 401(k) plan, but Katie
          doesn’t want to start saving from scratch. She’s determined to find
          her old passwords and take action.

          Katie has three options. A lot of her friends have cashed out their
          accounts, but lost half of their nest egg to penalties and taxes. Katie
          could also do nothing, but she's worried about juggling multiple
          investments and rising fees eroding her old balances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katie decides consolidating into a single account is the best
          decision.

          Starting the process comes with a host of questions: What are the tax
          implications of a transfer? Can a 403(b) transfer into an 401(k)?
          What's a Roth account? Should she manage her own money or hire an
          advisor?
        </p>
        <p>
          She tries to find the answers on her own, but it's difficult for her
          to know if she’s on the right track.

          When she finally initiates her transfer, Katie feels like her life has
          been taken over by phone calls, mailing forms, and faxing information
          between her providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her effort, it’s been months and her accounts haven’t been
          consolidated. There seems to be no end in sight.
